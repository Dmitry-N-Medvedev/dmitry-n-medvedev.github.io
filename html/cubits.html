    Cubits used home grown CRM - Cubits Management Interface - written in Django. All was good until the CEO brought back from his business journey twice
    as many customers as the company had.

    The CMI started to choke on the amount of data. I was given a carte blanche to fix it however I want.

    <dt>How I fixed it</dt>
    <dd>
      After playing a bit with Django, I decided it was high time to go away from monolith to microservices.

      The system has been split into separate layers: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end ran by NodeJS and React/Redux.
      The front-end was talking to the back-end via a websocket connection. Each command from the front-end would be transmitted 
      to the RabbitMQ server and routed further according to the back-end logic to appropriate handlers (microservices). As soon as a reqest is done
      its result would be pushed back to the front-end.

      In order to incure as little of a load as possible onto the main system, I organized data transfer from the main database to a Postgres/Redis instances.

      As soon as data migration pipeline was ready, I have implemented a live search feature. Should you need to search for a transaction by any of its
      attributes (transaction time, its owner, its value, etc) you would just start typing attributes in the search field and the back-end would push 
      the suggestions back to your browser.
