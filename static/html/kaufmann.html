    The context
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Restaurants order stuff from their local suppliers - bottled water, carrots, potato, meat, household chemicals - everything.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    The ordering process involves giving a call to the supplier and go through a list of items, their amount and specification.
  </dd>
  
  <dl>
    <dt>E.g.</dt>
    <dd>
      A restaurant wants to order water of a specific manufacturer bottled in glass. No plastic. Just because the bottles
      will be served on tables and it is not nice to serve plastic bottles to guests.
    </dd>

<dl>
  <dt>
    The problems
  </dt>
  <dt>
    The communication medium is not reliable enough
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This makes it inevitable to constantly double check that each item on the list is understood by the recepient correctly
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Either party or both speak very basic German
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Not all restaurants are run by native German speakers.
    Thus a lot of mistakes especially on <a class='term' href='https://bit.ly/2yg0qNr' target='_blank'>paronyms</a> are being constantly made and
    have to be corrected by repeating such items again and again
  </dd>

  <dt>Changing an order after it has been agreed upon</dt>
  <dd>
    Oftentimes a restaurant manager has to add items to the order they already have made. Now they need to give a call to their supplier,
    wait online until the supplier is ready to answer and go with the supplier through the order again to make necessary modifications to it.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    The supplier is also not very happy about changing orders. Not all suppliers
    (we are not talking about the <a class='term' href='https://bit.ly/2xDxSNv' target='_blank'>Getr√§nke Hoffmann</a>) do their book keeping using at least 
    <a class='term' href='https://bit.ly/3bH4ZyZ' target='_blank'>Google Sheets</a>.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    And even after all the necessary checks are made the worn out supplier delivers water in plastic bottles instead of glass ones.

<dl>
  <dt>One Million Euro Idea</dt>
  <dd>
    Why not giving these poor people a simple tool to manage the ordering process?
